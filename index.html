    <h1>Assignment B</h1>
    <hr />

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
        Hey, I'm Josh. <small>(Or <em>Joshua</em>, if you'd rather.)</small> I
        graduated from G.P. Vanier Secondary in 2020, which is where I developed
        my passion for technology. The robotics classroom in particular was my
        home turf, but I also took a variety of engineering, mathematics, and
        graphic design classes.
    </p>

    <p>If you need to reach me, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Send me an <a href="mailto:jcoppel@northislandcollege.ca">email</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Direct message me through
            <a href="https://digitaldesign-f2i3028.slack.com/archives/C03UY4F75KN">Slack</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is my experience with the web?</h2>
    <p>
        My experience started as a child, on my Dad's ancient Windows XP computer,
        which I would use to play games, watch videos, and (not intentionally)
        install viruses on. As for <em>valuable</em> web skills like actual
        website building, I'm regrettably inexperienced. I've previously played
        around with stuff like Blogger, Wordpress, Tumblr, and even making my own
        websites from scratch, but never really delved deeper than surface-level.
    </p>

    <h2>Do I know any coding languages?</h2>
    <p>
        Oh, a couple. My amount of formal education in each of these varies, so a
        lot of my knowledge is self-taught and supplemented with online resources.
        Here's a list of the languages I'd say I'm comfortable with, in descending
        order:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>
            Lua
            <s>(Which is technically a <em>scripting</em> language and not a
                <em>coding</em> language, but I don't care.)</s>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What would I like from this course?</h2>
    <p>
        For this course, I'm most interested in strengthening my web development
        skills. As previously mentioned, it's the area I feel the least confident
        in.
